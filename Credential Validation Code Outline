create table user_info (    
	user_id VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
password VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
name VARCHAR(40),
PRIMARY KEY(user_id)
);
-> This block of code basically says that user id can be a max of 15 characters and cannot be null, while password also cannot be null but can be a max of 20 characters.  

Pseudo-code for logic of connecting frontend with backend:
if user clicks on sign up:
	ask for user_id and password
	check if uder_id already exists, if so:
		as for new user_id

insert into user_info VALUES(user_id, password, name);
-> this line adds new members to the database

When logging in:
Pull the password using the primary key (user_id), cross check if the entered password equals the set password.

*Will add this code to Github after fleshing it out more next week
