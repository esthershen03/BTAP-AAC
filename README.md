# Sri Vaishnavi Ghantasala
Hello! Welcome to my GitHub Repository for the BTAP VIP. My name is Sri Vaishnavi Ghantasala. I am a coder on the AAC subteam. My subteam within AAC is Text-to-speech and a focus on database management (an area new to me). This is my second semester, so most of my work is sample implementations and additional research. I will list all the files in this repository and a brief review of each one below:

Previous semester files:
1. Aphasia notes - Sri Vaishnavi Ghantasala: This includes all my notes on Aphasia from the three following Aphasia videos, where I learned about the causes, consequences, and effects of Aphasia: <br>

2. Tutorials & Challenges: This includes all my code from tutorials, including what I learned about each topic (like adding Buttons, functions, structures, etc)c, this file also includes code from all the challenges I did as a part of the tutorial.
3. Task 2 and 3 - Sri Vaishnavi Ghantasala.pdf: All the notes from the videos and quizzes from the tutorials. This is the link to the tutorials: https://learn.codewithchris.com/courses/start
4. Mini project - M2 Task 4: This file includes the code for the mini project I built, which has scenes 1 and 2 from the protoypes I included in my notebook.
5. Final Project: This file includes the code to the final project, which is a modification of the mini-project, with text-to-speech componenets, which are a modification of Sydney's text-to-speech code. I worked on this with Esther Shen
Note: Neither Esther nor me have a mac, and weren't able to get XCode to work despite multiple attempts, so the above code files might not be compilable.
