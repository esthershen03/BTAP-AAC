create table name_of_table ();

//Here, create and table are keywords. All commands in SQL end with a ;
//Ex:
//Coding tutorial:

create table student (
	student_id INT,
name VARCHAR(length of the name string),
major VARCHAR(length of major string),
PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);

//Updating and deleting information:
insert into student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology'); //creates table

//You can add constraints to say that certain variables cannot be certain values. For example: you can say:

name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL

UPDATE student
SET major = 'Bio'
WHERE major = 'Biology';

//This sets the value of something when a certain constraint is true. This entire code block is one line since the semi colon is at the end of the three lines.

//Querying Data:

SELECT * FROM student;

//SELECT means that we are getting information
//* means every

SELECT name FROM student; 

//would get back all the names of the students.
